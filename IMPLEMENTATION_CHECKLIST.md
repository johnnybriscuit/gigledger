- **Effective Rate**: 26.1%

### For $1000 Gig in California (5% placeholder):
- **Federal**: $120.00
- **SE Tax**: $141.30
- **State**: $50.00 (5% placeholder)
- **Total**: $311.30

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### If withholding card doesn't show:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `profiles` and `state_tax_rates` tables exist
3. Verify user profile has state_code set
4. Check env variables are loaded (restart server)

### If state tax is wrong:
1. Check user's state_code in profiles table
2. Verify state rate exists in state_tax_rates
3. Check that placeholder rates are marked as such

### If app won't load:
1. Check Supabase connection
2. Verify RLS policies are correct
3. Check that fallback calculations work
