## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
Added new field to `payers` table:

Updated payer types to match your Google Sheet:
- Added: **Individual**
- Added: **Corporation**
- Existing: Venue, Client, Platform, Other

### 2. UI Updates
**Payer Form:**
- âœ… Added "Expect 1099?" checkbox
- âœ… Reordered types: Individual, Corporation, Venue, Client, Platform, Other
- âœ… Checkbox shows "Will receive 1099 form from this payer"

**Payers List:**
- âœ… Shows blue "1099" badge next to payer type if expect_1099 is true
- âœ… Badge only appears for payers who will send 1099s

### 3. Files Updated
- `src/types/database.types.ts` - Added expect_1099 field and new types
- `src/lib/validations.ts` - Updated schema validation
- `src/components/AddPayerModal.tsx` - Added checkbox UI
- `src/screens/PayersScreen.tsx` - Added 1099 badge display
- `supabase/migrations/add_expect_1099.sql` - Database migration

## ðŸ”§ Action Required: Run SQL Migration

You need to run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

**Go to**: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/jvostkeswuhfwntbrfzl/sql/new

**Run this SQL**:
```sql
-- Add expect_1099 field to payers table
ALTER TABLE payers ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS expect_1099 BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;

-- Update the payer_type enum to include Individual and Corporation
ALTER TYPE payer_type ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'Individual';
ALTER TYPE payer_type ADD VALUE IF NOT EXISTS 'Corporation';
```

**Note**: If you get an error about enum values already existing, that's OK - it means they're already there!

## Testing After Migration

1. **Refresh the app** in your browser
2. **Go to Payers tab**
3. **Click "+ Add Payer"**
4. You should see:
   - Type buttons: Individual, Corporation, Venue, Client, Platform, Other
   - "Expect 1099?" checkbox
5. **Create a payer** with:
   - Name: "John Doe"
   - Type: Individual
   - Check "Expect 1099?"
6. **Save** and verify:
   - Payer appears in list
   - Blue "1099" badge shows next to "Individual"

## What This Enables

Now you can:
- Track which payers will send you 1099 forms
- Easily identify 1099 payers with the blue badge
- Match your Google Sheet structure
- Prepare for tax season by knowing who to expect 1099s from

## Next Steps

After running the migration and testing, you can:
- Import your existing payers from the Google Sheet
- Continue with M3 (Expenses + Receipts)
- Or make any other adjustments you need!
