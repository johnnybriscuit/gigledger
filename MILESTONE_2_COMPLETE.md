4. Click "Add Payer"
5. Should appear in list immediately

### 2. Add a Gig

2. Click "+ Add Gig"
3. Select the payer you just created

## Technical Highlights

### Data Flow
```
User Action → Component
   ↓
TanStack Query Hook (usePayers/useGigs)
   ↓
Supabase Client
   ↓
PostgreSQL with RLS
   ↓
Response cached by TanStack Query
   ↓
UI updates automatically
```

### Auto-Calculation
Gigs automatically calculate net amount:
```typescript
net_amount = gross_amount + tips - fees
```

This happens both:
- In the UI (live preview)
- In the database (stored value)

### Type Safety
- Supabase types generated from database schema
- Zod schemas for runtime validation
- TypeScript for compile-time safety
- Full end-to-end type safety

## Known Limitations

1. **Date Picker**: Currently using text input (YYYY-MM-DD format)
   - Will add proper date picker in M5

2. **No Filtering Yet**: All gigs/payers shown
   - Date range filters coming in M4

3. **No CSV Export Yet**: Coming in M3/M4

4. **No PDF Reports Yet**: Coming in M5

## Next: Milestone 3

M3 will add:
- Expenses CRUD
- Receipt uploads to Supabase Storage
- Image/PDF thumbnails
- View receipts with signed URLs
- CSV export for expenses

## Files Created
